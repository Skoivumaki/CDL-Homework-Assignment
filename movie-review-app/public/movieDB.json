It blends crime, family drama, and Shakespearean tragedy into a rich portrait of power and loyalty. The performances, especially by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, are captivating, and the pacing makes its long runtime feel purposeful rather than excessive. More than a gangster film, it’s a meditation on legacy and the cost of ambition — one that still feels timeless today."
